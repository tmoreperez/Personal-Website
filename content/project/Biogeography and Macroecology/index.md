Biogeography is the study of the geographic and temporal distributions of life. Biogeographic information can help us understand species' adaptations and their evolutionary histories. In recent years, a wealth of plant biogeographic data - [largely from digitized herbarium specimens]({{< relref "project/Museum Collections/index.md" >}} "Museum Collections") - has become publicly available. Coupled with macro- and microclimate data, this biogeographic data has been particularly valuable for understanding how plants are shifting their distributions in response to climate change. 

As plants shift their distributions, plant communities can become altered. These alterations may include changes in community diversity and to ecosystem services like carbon storage. A goal of my research is to understand patterns in plant biogeography in order to predict about how climate change will alter plant communities and inform conservation decisions.
