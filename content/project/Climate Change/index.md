Anthropogenic climate change is a complex process that is partially characterized by increasing climatic temperatures and increasing climatic variability. Furthermore, climate change is occurring at a pace that is unprecedented in Earth's history. The short-term and long-term consequences of climate change on plants are unclear. I'm interested in understanding how climate change will influence the physiological functions of plants and these functions translate to broader patterns in plant ecology.
