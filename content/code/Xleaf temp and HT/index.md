title: "Main figures from 'Photosynthetic heat tolerances and extreme leaf temperatures' publication"
---

## Overview
This script reproduces the main figures and analyses for the publication [Photosynthetic heat tolerances and extreme leaf temperatures]({{< ref "publication/Functional.Ecology.2020/index.md" >}} "Photosystem II heat tolerances characterize thermal generalists and the upper limit of carbon assimilation."). The analyses and figures are very simple and consist of linear models, correlation coefficients, and a sensitivity analysis. 


Here is a [link to GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmoreperez/XLeaf.temp.and.Heat.tolerance) with the data used in the main text. Species occurrences were obtain from GBIF using a modified version of the R script that [can be found here.]({{< ref "code/PGaCER/index.md" >}}) Microclimate data was obtained from the NicheMapR R package. Extension documentation of that package can be found here: https://mrke.github.io/. The code used to estimate photosynthetic heat tolerances [can be found here.]({{< ref "code/Heat tolerance/index.md" >}})
