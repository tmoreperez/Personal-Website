Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Michaletz Lab](https://michaletzlab.org/) at the University of British Columbia. I completed my PhD in December 2019 in the [Feeley Lab](https://www.junglebiology.org/) at University of Miami. My dissertation focused on understanding the ecophysiology of photosynthetic heat tolerances of tropical plants.

I also work with the [Alliance for a Sustainable Amazon](https://www.sustainableamazon.org/), a non-profit that aims to promote the conservation of natural resources in the Amazon through sustainable agriculture, biological research and monitoring, community engagement and education.
