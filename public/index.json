Another parameter, Tmax indicates the high temperature at which carbon assimilation approaches zero is also produced by the function code.\nThere are two different models that are used to estimate these parameters. The paper linked above provides details on the different equations that are used. Parameters other than those listed above can be obtained from these equations. However, the function currently only provides output for estimates of Popt, Topt, Omega, and Tmax. The function also includes an option to produce a basic plot of the data.\nThis is an example of the figure that is produced from the function. Each point represents a different leaf for one species (Brosimum alicastrum in this case). The \u0026lsquo;Photosynthesis\u0026rsquo; on the y-axis indicates the amount of carbon assimilated at a given temperature.

Biogeographic information can help us understand species' adaptations and their evolutionary histories. In recent years, a wealth of plant biogeographic data - largely from digitized herbarium specimens - has become publicly available. Coupled with macro- and microclimate data, this biogeographic data has been particularly valuable for understanding how plants are shifting their distributions in response to climate change.\nAs plants shift their distributions, plant communities can become altered. These alterations may include changes in community diversity and to ecosystem services like carbon storage.
